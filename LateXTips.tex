\documentclass[a4paper]{scrreprt} %Uses a KOMA-Script class, which looks much more like European print media (they were made by Europeans not Americans, so duh!)
%The documentclass specifies what sort of document you are creating and the options specify things like A4 format. This could all be done by hand, but that's WAY too complicated.
%Use report, because report includes \newpage in front of the table of contents and new chapters



\input{LaTeXPreamble.tex} %This essentially copy&pastes the entire contents of LaTeXPreamble.tex into this file


%Metadata
%This doesn't get imported, because the title will change...
\title{FHNW-Informatik Zusammenfassungstemplate} 
\author{Jan Fässler, Fabio Oesch, Fabian Stebler \& Mark Zeman} 																 %Add your name if you contribute!
\date{2. Semester (FS 2012)} 																																		 %If the file gets updated with info from later semesters / years, add them, so that all the semesters are visible
\fancyfoot[C]{If you use this documentation for a exam, you should offer a beer to the authors!} %Replace with appropriate beverage or food if beer ain't your thing :)


\begin{document} 						%Now you leave the preamble (config) and start the actual content

\maketitle 									%This takes all the metadata (and could take a few more things) and makes a fancy title page from it

\tableofcontents						%This will take all our parts > chapters > sections > subsections > subsubsections and turn them into a nice table of contents

\chapter{Grundlegende Formatierungen} 		%A new chapter always starts on a new page
	\section{Untertitel}										%Sections don't
		\subsection{Weitere Verschachtelung}  %This can go on, but the table of contents only goes down to subsection for report and book and subsubsection (starting at section, not chapter) for article

\end{document}
